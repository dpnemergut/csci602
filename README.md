This is a repository for CSCI602 assignments (obviously).

Basic git workflow:

1) Clone down the repo (first time only): git clone https://github.com/dpnemergut/csci602.git OR git clone git@github.com:dpnemergut/csci602.git

2) Bring in all the changes since you last worked on the project: git pull

3) Edit the files as you please

4) When you reach a good milestone: git add file/that/you/edited

5) Repeat step 4 for all files that you edited (git status shows all changes)

6) Commit the files: git commit -m "Say what you changed"

7) Repeat steps 2-6 as needed.

8) Send all of your commits to Github: git push origin HEAD
