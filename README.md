This is a repository for CSCI602 assignments (obviously).

Basic git workflow:
1) Clone down the repo: git clone https://github.com/dpnemergut/csci602.git OR git clone git@github.com:dpnemergut/csci602.git

2) Edit the files as you please (git pull brings in all the changes since you last worked on the project, do this before editing if it's been awhile).

3) When you reach a good milestone: git add file/that/you/edited

4) Repeat step 3 for all files that you edited (git status shows all changes)

5) Commit the files: git commit -m "Say what you changed"

6) Repeat steps 2-6 as needed.

7) Send all of your commits to Github: git push origin HEAD
